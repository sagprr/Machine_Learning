## Processing Image Data for Deep Learning


This project is designed to guide users through the process of effectively processing image data for deep learning applications. The core working of the project can be summarized into three main steps:

### Data Preprocessing: 
The project provides a series of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that walk users through the essential steps of data preprocessing. This includes tasks such as resizing images to a consistent dimension, normalizing pixel values, and addressing data imbalances. The notebooks offer detailed explanations and code examples to help users understand and implement these preprocessing steps.

### Data Augmentation: 
To enhance model robustness and reduce overfitting, the project demonstrates the application of data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation involves creating variations of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the images, such as rotations, flips, and zooms. Users can explore how to implement data augmentation in their deep learning pipelines to improve model generalization.

### Dataset Splitting: 
Properly dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets is crucial for model evaluation and training. The project provides guidance on how to split the data effectively and ensure that the splits are representative of the overall dataset. Users will learn how to implement stratified splitting to maintain class distribution integrity, which is especially important in classification tasks.
