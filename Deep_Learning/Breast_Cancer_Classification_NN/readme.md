## Breast_Cancer_Classification_NN

Early detection of breast cancer is vital for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. 
This project leverages neural networks, a powerful tool in machine learning, to create a 
robust classification model. Here's an overview of the project's key components:




### Dataset:
The project utilizes a breast cancer dataset containing various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies. These features serve as input to the neural network. The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets to facilitate model development and evaluation.


### Neural Network Architecture: 
The neural network architecture is designed to effectively learn and classify breast cancer tumors. It typically consists of input layers, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Activation functions, dropout layers, and batch normalization may be incorporated for improved model performance.

### Training and Evaluation:
The project includes scripts and notebooks guiding you through the process of training the neural network on the training dataset. The model is then evaluated on the testing dataset using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance.
