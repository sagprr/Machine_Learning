## Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Network


Face mask detection is a critical application in the context of public health and safety. This repository provides a comprehensive solution to address this challenge using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project encompasses the following key components:


### 1. Dataset: 
The heart of any deep learning project is the dataset. This project includes a dataset containing images of individuals with and without face masks. The dataset is organized into training, validation, and test sets, enabling the development and evaluation of a robust face mask detection model.

### 2. Model Architecture: 
We employ a CNN-based architecture for this project. Convolutional layers extract relevant features from the input images, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The model is designed to predict whether an individual is wearing a mask correctly, incorrectly, or not wearing one at all.

### 3. Training and Evaluation: 
The project provides scripts and Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the process of training the CNN model on the dataset. It covers aspects such as data preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, and evaluation metrics. You can fine-tune the model to achieve high accuracy and robustness.





Some of the essential libraries and their typical use cases:

### Python: 
Python serves as the primary programming language for deep learning projects due to its extensive libraries and frameworks for machine learning and data processing.


### TensorFlow or PyTorch: 
These deep learning frameworks provide the tools and functionalities to build, train, and evaluate neural networks. You would typically choose one of these frameworks based on your preference and project requirements.


### Keras: 
Keras is often used as a high-level API that sits on top of TensorFlow or other backend frameworks. It simplifies the construction of neural networks and is well-suited for quick model prototyping.


### OpenCV: 
OpenCV is a library for computer vision tasks and is often used for image preprocessing, especially in projects involving image data like face mask detection.


### NumPy: 
NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical operations in Python. It is widely used for data manipulation and handling arrays, which are common data structures in deep learning.


### Matplotlib or Seaborn: 
These libraries are used for data visualization, allowing you to create plots and graphs to analyze model performance and dataset characteristics.


### Scikit-learn:
While primarily known for traditional machine learning, Scikit-learn can be useful for tasks like splitting datasets, calculating evaluation metrics, and performing data preprocessing steps.


### Pandas: 
Pandas is a data manipulation library that simplifies data handling tasks such as reading and writing data, data cleaning, and data transformation.
