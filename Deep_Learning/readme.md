# Image Processing with Deep Learning using cv2, matplotlib

This repository contains code examples and utilities for image processing using OpenCV (cv2) and matplotlib libraries in Python. The examples focus on performing common image processing tasks, such as RGB to grayscale conversion, reading an image file, and converting it to a NumPy array.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
Matplotlib library
