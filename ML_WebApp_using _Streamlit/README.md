# ML Project Deployment with Streamlit

This readme file provides a step-by-step guide on how to deploy a machine learning (ML) project using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. Streamlit allows you to build user-friendly interfaces to showcase your ML models and share them with others.

## Prerequisites
Before starting the deployment process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Python (3.6 or later)
2. pip (Python package installer)
3. Anaconda 
4. Streamlit 
5. Sypder 


### Anaconda: 
Download and install Anaconda from the official Anaconda website (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

### Spyder: 
Anaconda comes with Spyder, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python. Ensure that you have Spyder installed and running.

### StreamLit: 

1. Install Streamlit: Use the pip install streamlit command to install Streamlit library.

2. Create a Streamlit App: Create a new Python file, e.g., app.py, and import the Streamlit library using import streamlit as st.

3. Define the App's User Interface: Inside the Python file, define the app's user interface using Streamlit functions. For example, use st.title() to set the app's title and add other UI components as needed.

4. Run the Streamlit App: Run the Streamlit app by adding the following code at the end of the Python file:

   if __name__ == '__main__':
   
      main()

6. Run the App: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your app.py file is located, and use the command streamlit run app.py to run the Streamlit app.
7. Build the App: Use Streamlit functions and components to build interactive elements in your app, such as st.write() to display text, data, and visualizations, and st.button() or st.selectbox() to create interactive input components.
8. Deployment: Deploy your Streamlit app using platforms like Heroku, Streamlit Sharing, or Docker. Consult the respective platform's documentation for detailed instructions on how to deploy your Streamlit app.
