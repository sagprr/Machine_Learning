# Machine Learning Model Projects

This Git repository contains various machine learning model projects developed for different purposes. Each project focuses on solving a specific problem using machine learning techniques.


## Car Price Prediction
The Car Price Prediction project aims to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as the car's brand, model, mileage, year of manufacture, and other relevant factors. The project utilizes regression algorithms to create a predictive model.
Once the installation is complete, you can use the Car Price Prediction tool to make price predictions for used cars.


##  Credit Card Fraud Detection
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained on a dataset containing a mixture of legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Classification algorithms are employed to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities, providing an effective fraud detection mechanism.

## Fake News Prediction
The Fake News Prediction project aims to detect and classify fake news articles. The model is trained using a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles. Natural language processing techniques and classification algorithms are employed to identify patterns and features that distinguish between real and fake news.

## Mine Rock Detection Lab
The Mine Rock Detection Lab project is designed to identify rocks and mines from sonar readings. It utilizes acoustic signals and sonar data to train a classification model. The model can differentiate between rocks and mines, providing a useful tool for underwater mine detection.

## Movie Recommendation System
The Movie Recommendation System project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. It utilizes collaborative filtering and recommendation algorithms to analyze user preferences and make movie recommendations based on their past ratings and similarities with other users.


## Spam Mail Detection
The Spam Mail Detection project focuses on identifying spam emails. The model is trained on a dataset containing both legitimate and spam emails. Natural language processing techniques and classification algorithms are employed to identify spam patterns and accurately classify incoming emails.


## Diabetes Prediction Model
The Diabetes Prediction Model project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not. The model is trained on a dataset containing medical records and relevant features such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), glucose levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators.
