## Loan Prediction System using SVM

This repository contains code for a Loan Prediction System implemented using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification. The system predicts loan application approval or denial based on applicant information

This repository introduces a Loan Prediction System driven by Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification. The system's core objective is to determine the approval or denial of loan applications, relying on a diverse set of applicant features. The workflow is straightforward: begin by cloning the repository and establishing a Python virtual environment. 

Next, incorporate your loan application dataset in CSV format within the designated data directory. Tailor the system's behavior by configuring parameters in the config.py file, encompassing dataset paths and SVM hyperparameters. Execute the main.py script to facilitate data preprocessing, SVM model training, and subsequent performance evaluation. The outcome encompasses essential evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

The trained SVM model is persistently stored in the models directory, accessible for future predictions. Contributors are heartily welcomed to enrich the system through issue generation and pull requests, fostering collaborative growth.
