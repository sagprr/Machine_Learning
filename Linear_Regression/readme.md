### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a widely used supervised learning algorithm for predicting continuous numerical values. It establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable by fitting a best-fitting straight line through the data points. This line is represented by a linear equation of the form:
## y = mx + b

where:

y is the predicted target variable.

x is the input feature.

m is the slope (coefficient) of the line.

b is the y-intercept (bias) of the line.

### Model Training
The training process in linear regression involves finding the best values of m and b that minimize the cost function. 
This is typically achieved using optimization techniques like gradient descent, where the model iteratively 
updates the coefficients to move towards the optimal values that result in the smallest MSE.


## Implementation

Implementing linear regression involves either using existing libraries like Scikit-learn in Python, which provides a simple API for linear regression, or building the algorithm from scratch using mathematical formulas and optimization techniques.

When using libraries, one can easily create a linear regression model, fit it to the training data, make predictions on new data, and evaluate its performance using various metrics.

Overall, linear regression remains a fundamental and powerful tool in the domain of regression analysis, and understanding its principles is essential for any data scientist or machine learning practitioner.
