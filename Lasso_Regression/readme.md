## Lasso Regression

Lasso Regression, short for "Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator," 
is a linear regression technique that incorporates L1 regularization into the standard 
linear regression model. It is used for various regression tasks, particularly when dealing with 
high-dimensional datasets and feature selection.

### Feature Selection and Regularization
The L1 regularization term in the cost function introduces sparsity in the model by encouraging some coefficients to become exactly zero. Consequently, Lasso Regression can effectively perform feature selection by identifying and excluding less relevant features. This is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets
where the number of features is larger than the number of samples.
By setting some coefficients to zero, Lasso Regression can build a simpler and more interpretable model compared to standard linear regression, where all features are included.


## Applications

Lasso Regression has various applications in fields such as:

Finance: Predicting stock prices, credit risk modeling, etc.

Medicine: Predicting disease progression, drug response, etc.

Image Processing: Feature extraction, object recognition, etc.

Natural Language Processing: Text classification, sentiment analysis, etc.
